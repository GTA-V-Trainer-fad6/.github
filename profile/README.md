## 🎮 What Is a GTA V Trainer?

A **trainer** is a cheat tool that hooks into the GTA V game process and lets you toggle different features in real-time using keyboard shortcuts or a simple UI. Trainers are built for **Story Mode only** — they’re perfect for offline chaos or cinematic gameplay.

You don’t need to mod files or run a full menu. Just launch, enable, and dominate.
